	<p>Each year, the rock & roll hall of fame foundation nominating comitee selects the group of artists nominated in the performer category.</p>

	<p>Ballots are then sent to more than 1,000 historians, members of the music industry and artists—including every living Rock Hall inductee—and the five performers receiving the most votes become that year's induction class. Beginning in 2012, fans were given the chance to vote for the nominees they'd like to see inducted into the Rock Hall. The top five vote-getters in the public poll form one ballot, which is weighted the same as the rest of the submitted ballots. </p>
